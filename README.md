Personal website for full-stack web developer John Shea

Todo:
* Set up "about" window to display by default and showcase basic resume info in the style of the macOS "about this mac" window
* use AngularJS 1.0 as a window management system
* get at least partial faux menus working on the menubar
* add battery status indicator (default to "plugged in" symbol)

Bugs:
* traffic lights are too close to top and left of window, don't adjust to header bar size

Future design considerations:
* Does the clock have to update every second? We can probably scale that back for performance gains. Maybe ever 15 seconds?
* Update the app from AngularJS 1 with Javascript to AngularJS 2 with TypeScript and NPM
